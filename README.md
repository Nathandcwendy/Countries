### What I learned

I learned a lot about the WebApi History and Location objects. With React Router Dom, I was able to achieve client-side routing which helped me make my app more sustainable while seeming like it actually fetches new pages from a server when it doesn't.

Working with countries that have different languages, I had to implement some language sensitive comparisons and renders.

### Continued development

I would like to work on more projects that involve routing in the future, i still have a lot to learn and understand and also, I haven't fully learnt the concepts of the React Router Dom library, although I know enough to create a SPA with routes that work efficiently.
